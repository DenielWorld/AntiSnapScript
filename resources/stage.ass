//Variable declaration statements with multiple variables that feature at least one list MUST NOT have
//any other variable types. Booleans, strings, and integers can safely be declared within one
//variable declaration statement.

//The variables declared outside of the scripting/listening scope must be public or private.
//The default values are optional, without them we use Snap's default of 0.
